## 🛠️ Tech Stack

This project is built with a modern frontend stack:

- **[Angular 20](https://angular.io/):** A powerful framework for building dynamic web apps.
- **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/):** A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
- **[SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/):** A CSS preprocessor with more features than plain CSS.
- **[RxJS](https://rxjs.dev/):** A library for reactive programming using Observables.
- **[Express.js](https://expressjs.com/):** Used for server-side rendering (SSR) with Angular SSR.
- **[AOS](https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/):** Animate On Scroll library for animations.

---

## ✨ Features

- **Modern UI/UX:** Clean, modern design with a great user experience.
- **Responsive Design:** Fully responsive and works on all devices, from mobile to desktop.
- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR):** With Angular SSR for better performance and SEO.
- **Dark/Light Theme:** A theme switcher to toggle between dark and light modes.
- **SEO Optimized:** Meta tags and structured data for better search engine visibility.
- **Performance Optimized:** Optimized for fast loading times.
- **Multi-language Support (i18n):** Ready for internationalization.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- **Node.js:** [Download and install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (which includes npm).
- **Angular CLI:** Install the Angular CLI globally by running:
  ```sh
  npm install -g @angular/cli
  ```

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/PhilipRamkeerat/philip-portfolio.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```sh
   cd philip-portfolio
   ```
3. **Install NPM packages:**
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

---

## 💻 Usage

To run the project in development mode, use the following command. This will start a local development server.

```sh
npm start
```

Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

---

## 🏗️ Building the Project

To create a production-ready build of the application, run the following command:

```sh
npm run build
```

This command will compile the application and output the production-ready files to the `dist/philip-portfolio` directory. This includes both browser and server builds for SSR.

---

## 🚢 Deployment

The live demo is hosted on **GitHub Pages** at [philipramkeerat.github.io/philip-portfolio/home](https://philipramkeerat.github.io/philip-portfolio/home).

This project also includes a custom script to prepare the application for deployment on an Apache server such as Hostinger.

To create a deployment-ready package, run:

```bash
npm run build:hostinger
```

This command does the following:

1. Runs the standard `npm run build` command.
2. Executes the `scripts/prepare-hostinger.js` script which:
   - Copies the necessary build artifacts to the `hostinger-upload` directory.
   - Creates a custom `.htaccess` file with rules for routing, caching, and security.
   - Generates a `HOSTINGER-INSTRUCTIONS.md` with deployment steps.

To deploy the application, upload the contents of the `hostinger-upload` directory to the `public_html` folder of your web server.

> **Note:** The `prepare-hostinger.js` script currently relies on hardcoded file names for JS/CSS assets. For more robust deployments, consider modifying this script to dynamically read the filenames from the build output.

## 🔧 Customization

### Colors and Themes

You can easily customize the color scheme and theme of the application by editing the CSS variables in `src/app/app.scss`:

```scss
/* Example theme variables in src/app/app.scss */
:root {
  --primary-color: #6366f1;
  --bg-primary: #0f172a;
  --text-primary: #f8fafc;
  /* ... and more ... */
}
```

### Content

All content is managed within the Angular components located in `src/app/components/`. You can update the text, images, and other content by editing the HTML templates and TypeScript files in each component.

---

## 📊 Performance

This project is highly optimized for performance, achieving excellent Lighthouse scores. Key performance features include:

- **Gzip Compression:** Enabled for all text-based files via the `.htaccess` configuration.
- **Cache Headers:** Optimized cache control for static assets to reduce load times for returning visitors.
- **Pre-rendered Pages:** SSR ensures fast initial page loads and improved SEO.
- **Lazy Loading:** Feature modules can be configured to load on demand.

---

## 🔒 Security

The application includes several security measures to protect against common web vulnerabilities:

- **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Helps prevent XSS attacks.
- **X-Content-Type-Options:** Prevents MIME-sniffing.
- **X-Frame-Options:** Protects against clickjacking.
- **X-XSS-Protection:** Enables the cross-site scripting (XSS) filter in browsers.

These headers are configured in the `.htaccess` file generated by the deployment script.
